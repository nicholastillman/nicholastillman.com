    <p>Hi, my name is Nicholas, I am a UI designer and developer living in Texas.
    I grew up in a small town in central Oklahoma and spent my childhood enjoying the outdoors and spending quality time with my family and friends.</p>Â¸
    <p>Growing up, I was your typical kid, riding bikes, playing  video games, and liking to watch early Saturday morning cartoons. If  we're up early enough, I could catch an episode of Bob Ross with my  brother.
    Now that I'm all grown up, (at least I pretend to be ;), I spend time wrtiting code alongside designing with pixels in figma and sketch. When I'm not designing or coding, you'll find me hanging with my wife and  kiddos, playing the piano, or learning as much as possible about permaculture, micro farming and architecture.</p>

  <p>Nice to meet ya, and thanks for visiting. <br />
